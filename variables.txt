Variables

A variable is a container that temporarily saves a data value during the execution of a program.
• A variable name can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore and dollar characters.
• A variable name must always start with a letter as ‘_’ and ‘$’ are not • conventionally used.
• Whitespaces are not permitted.
• Keywords can not be used as variable names.
• Variable names are case-sensitive.

**Declaration**
Declaration of a variable is the process of creating and introducing the variable into your program. Once declared, a variable can not change its type throughout the program**.**
`data_type variable_name;`

**Initialisation**
The initialisation of a variable involves assigning a value to the variable. A variable can be assigned different values throughout the program, but the type of value is restricted to the declared data type.
`data_type variable_name = value;`
