Data Types

Java has two types of data:
**Primitive Data Type
Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data Type**

**Primitive Data Type**
The programming language pre-defines a primitive data type. It contains no extra sophisticated methods and specifies the size and type of variable values.
**Boolean data type
byte data type
char data type
short data type
int data type
long data type
float data type
double data type**

**Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data Type**
These data types are not actually defined by the programming language but are created by the programmer. These are also called Object Data Types or Reference Data types.
**Arrays
Strings
Classes
Interfaces**
